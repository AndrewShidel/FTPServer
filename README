How to Build:
    "make build"

How to run:
    "./FTPServer [port] [ssl port]"

Note that the server will read configuration from a config file called ftpserverd.conf which should be in the root directory of this project.

This server has been tested using my FTP client from HW2, the OSX buildin command line FTP client, and the FileZilla FTP client (with SSL both on and off).
